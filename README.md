# ## Introduction
This is a study conducted by a Data Scientist for Nairobi Hospital which previously conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. Nairobi Hospital is interested in having a model that predicts whether a patient has hypothyroidism or not by studying their symptoms.
The main aim of this study is to build a model that determines whether or not a patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.

## Motivation
The project was done as an assessment for a Data Science Course.
